Credits (for Durbie V1.1 STLs):
Wade V2 (M4) Extruder inspired and modified from original designs by Wade and Adrian Bowyer
Majority of Durbie V1.1 STL files are based on prusajr's original work and modified where necessary. 

Imported stuff (for PrusaMendel's cloned repo files):

Recommended to build using consolidated STL files in Durbie V1.1 folder: https://github.com/romscraj/PrusaMendel/tree/Durbie/Durbie/Durbie-V1.1-STLs

DEPRECATED (intended for reference only): Older files are in Durbie/Unique-STL-Files - note that this folder contains only the (old) Durbie unique STLs. If you are printing these older STLs, you will need to print the remainder of the parts (prusajr's Prusa Mendel parts that are common with the Durbie) that can be found here:
https://github.com/romscraj/PrusaMendel/tree/Durbie/stl
